## What I built

I built a Time Tracker Chrome Extension that helps users track and manage the amount of time they spend on websites. 
The extension allows users to view the time, website, the date they visited the website, and they can delete those data.


## Why I built it

There was a challenge on [dev.to](https://www.dev.to). I never had the experience of building an extension
before but I decided to participate in the challenge. And also becuase I wanted to know the amount of time I spent on websites.


### Here are some screenshots Screenshots
