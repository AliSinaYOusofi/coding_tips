## 10 git commands you should know
Since you are a bit familiar with git, here are 10 commands which you must know as a developer.

Here are the commands which we will look into:

1. git init [git init](#git-init)
2. git clone [git clone](#git-clone)
3. git status [git status](#git-status)
4. git log [git log](#git-log)
5. git branch [git branch](#git-branch)
6. git checkout [git checkout](#git-checkout)
7. git add [git add](#git-add)
8. git commit [git commit](#git-commit)
9. git push [git push](#git-push)
10. git stash[git stash](#git-stash)

1. ### git init
This command is for starting a new repository.
```bash
git init [repository name]
```

##### example:
```bash
git init demo

# output: Initialized empty Git repository in E:/Old E Drive/open-source/demo/.git/
```

### 2. git clone
This command is like copying a file from Github to your local machine.
```bash
git clone [url]
```
#### example:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/AliSinaYOusofi/TimeTrack
Cloning into 'TimeTrack'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 43, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (43/43), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (37/37), done.
remote: Total 43 (delta 2), reused 39 (delta 1), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (43/43), 204.92 KiB | 52.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), done.
```

### 3. git status
This command will list all the files which have to be commited.
```bash
git status
```

#### example:
```bash
$ git status
On branch first_blog
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   data/blog/make_your_project_open_source.mdx

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        data/blog/git_techniques.mdx
        data/blog/ten_git_commands_you_should_know.mdx

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

### 4. git log
This command will output a list of commits in reverse chronological order (most recent first).

```bash
git log
```

#### example:
```bash
commit 91a7ed71c36ab63e3153afe833e3796cb29f21ca (HEAD -> first_blog, origin/first_blog)
Author: HajiAli <senayousofiali@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Jul 28 08:31:18 2024 +0430

    added: another blog

commit 97f730a1799c9a853350ce01727803077d1242b7
Author: HajiAli <senayousofiali@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Jun 7 20:19:18 2024 +0430
```

**NOTE**: press q to exit log history.

### 5. git branch
This command lists all the local branches in the current repository.

```bash
git branch
```

#### example:
```bash
$ git branch
* first_blog
  main
``

### 5. git checkout
This command is used when moving from one branch to another branch.
```bash
git checkout [branch_name]
```

#### example:
```bash
git checkout main
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 18 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)
```

**NOTE**: the following command will create a new branch and swithes to that branch:

```bash
git checkout -b [branc_name]
```

### 7. git add
This command will add file to the stagin area.
```bash
git add [file_name]

```

#### example:
```bash
git add ./data/blog/git_techniques.mdx
warning: in the working copy of 'data/blog/git_techniques.mdx', CRLF will be replaced by LF the next time Git touches it
```

### 8. git commit
This command records the file permanently in the version history.

```bash
git commit -m [commit messages]
```

#### example:
```bash
git commit -m "added: some new blogs"
[master (root-commit) aff342] first commit
9 files changed, 200 insertions(+)
```

9. git push
This command sends the committed changes of master branch to your remote repository.

```bash
git push [a variable name] master

### 10. git stash ‚ù§Ô∏è
Firstly I love this command, it will temporarily stores all modified tracked files.
If you modified changes and don't want to commit those changes you can stash them.
```bash
git stash save
```

and to restore:
```bash
git stash pop
```

and to list all stashed files:
```bash
git stash list
```
